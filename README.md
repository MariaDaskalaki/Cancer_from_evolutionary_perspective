# Cancer_from_evolutionary_perspective

Forward time simulations of cancer cells in discrete time of generations, based on two populations(previous cell population and current cell population).

The initial cell population consists of healthy cells.

The code is written in C and takes two command line parameters: initial number of cells and number of generations.

A "Frequency.txt" and a "Frequency_mutations.txt" file are derived from the C-code. 

Plots of txt files are derived from the corresponding python codes.
